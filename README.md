# portfolio-FrontEnd
This is the repository for my personal project about my personal portfolio, which is part of the final project of "Argentina Programa", a national, free course to learn all 
the basics about full stack development.

Here i'll start with all the HTML and CSS for the static atributes of the web page, and then use the JavaScript framework Angular for the dinamic FrontEnd.
